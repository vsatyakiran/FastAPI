# What is a Framework? https://datascientest.com/en/fastapi-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-most-widely-used-python-web-framework-for-machine-learning#:~:text=Today%2C%20many%20world%2Drenowned%20companies,to%20code%2C%20speeding%20up%20development.

- A framework is a **collection of modules and packages** used to develop software and help developers avoid having to deal with low-level details.
- A framework is a set of tools and libraries that help you build complex applications.
- The three most widely used frameworks for developing web applications in Python are Django, Flask and FastAPI. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the use case. The three main Python frameworks are **Django**, **Flash** and **FastAPI**.

# What is FastAPI?

- FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), open source web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- Today, many world-renowned companies such as Uber, Netflix and Microsoft use FastAPI to build their applications.

- Its first strength is a high level of performance, comparable with NodeJS and Go. The framework is also very quick to code, speeding up development.

- This framework is designed to optimize the developerâ€™s experience, so that they can write simple code to build production-ready APIs using best practices.

- One of the main use cases for FastAPI is the creation of API endpoints. This task can be accomplished very easily using the OpenAPI standard, and in particular the Swagger UI interactive user interface.

- However, FastAPI is not limited to APIs. It can be used for any web framework use case, such as the delivery of legacy web pages with the Jinja2 templating engine, or for WebSockets-based applications.

- FastAPI is mainly used for data science and e-commerce applications. It enables developers to use the REST API and a wide range of functions to implement them in applications.

# FastAPI vs Flask vs Django

- Fast API is a high-performance, open-source Python web framework used to develop web APIs with the hint types of Python 3.6 or higher. It enables data types to be validated even within JSON requests.

- It is based on standards such as JSON Schema, OAuth 2.0 and OpenAPI. It also facilitates the creation of GraphQL APIs with a Python library called graphene-python.

- FastAPI is used in particular for use cases where speed is a priority. For example, Netflix uses it for internal crisis management.

- This framework is also perfectly suited to the deployment of Machine Learning models, since models work best in production when accompanied by a REST API and deployed as microservices.
